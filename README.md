# WME-Wazebar

Adds a small bar to the top of the screen that allows you to add links to parts of the wiki, forums , unlock forums, your inbox, and show the last tile build date/time.

The forum links will display the unread count for the first page of that forum. The inbox will also display an unread count.

See the [forum thread](https://www.waze.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=819&t=219816) for details.
